## Critical Success Factors

### Do These Things:
1. **Post volume** - More posts = more data = faster learning
2. **Track everything** - Can't improve what you don't measure
3. **Move fast** - Speed beats perfection
4. **Kill losers quickly** - Don't waste resources on what doesn't work
5. **Scale winners aggressively** - When something works, multiply it
6. **Document everything** - Your future self (and team) will thank you
7. **Stay compliant** - Platform bans kill businesses

### Avoid These Mistakes:
1. **Over-polishing content** - Done beats perfect
2. **Scaling before validation** - Data first, scale second
3. **Single account dependence** - Diversify always
4. **Ignoring metrics** - Flying blind is fatal
5. **Poor poster selection** - Quality matters
6. **Inconsistent posting** - Algorithm rewards consistency
7. **Neglecting funnel** - Traffic without conversion = nothing

## Final Note

This is a proven system, but success requires execution. The difference between operators who make $1k/month and those who make $100k/month is not knowledge—it's action.

Start today. Post your first video within 7 days. Get your first sale within 30 days. Scale from there.

The Eyeballs are waiting.
