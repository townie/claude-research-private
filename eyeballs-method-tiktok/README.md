# The Eyeballs Method

A comprehensive system for building faceless TikTok content empires that generate millions of views and convert those views into revenue through optimized funnels.

## Overview

The Eyeballs Method is a systematic approach to:
1. **Building AI-powered content engines** that produce endless faceless videos
2. **Automating distribution** across networks of accounts
3. **Engineering conversion funnels** that maximize revenue per view
4. **Scaling through networks** of commission-based posters and affiliates

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Introduction** - Understand the core framework
2. **Review the Build Plan** - See the 90-day roadmap
3. **Set up your tech stack** - Reference the tools guide
4. **Start Phase 1** - Build your content engine and funnel

## The Build Plan

See [BUILD-PLAN.md](./BUILD-PLAN.md) for the complete 90-day implementation roadmap with day-by-day tasks.

### Timeline Overview

- **Days 1-7:** Foundation and setup
- **Days 8-14:** Content and funnel building
- **Days 15-30:** Launch and testing
- **Days 31-45:** Optimization
- **Days 46-90:** Scaling and network building

## Key Concepts

### The Fundamental Equation
```
Daily Revenue = (Daily Views × CTR × CVR × AOV)
```

### The Two-Phase Scaling Method

**Phase 1: Your Machine (Data Collection)**
- Run 50-150 posts/day across your accounts
- Prove the funnel converts
- Gather your exact numbers: CTR, CVR, AOV
- De-risk the offer with your own data

**Phase 2: Their Machine (Distribution & Scale)**
- Recruit commission-based posters
- Offer 60-70% commission (proven, de-risked system)
- Scale to 500-5000+ posts/day through network
- Diversified distribution not dependent on your accounts

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CTR | 2%+ |
| CVR | 3%+ |
| AOV | $80-120 on $27 front-end |
| Viral Rate | 5-10% of posts hit 100k+ |
