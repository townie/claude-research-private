# Building Your AI Content Engine

## Overview

The content engine is your factory floor. It produces unlimited faceless TikTok videos at scale without you filming, editing, or appearing on camera. This document covers how to build, optimize, and operate this machine.

## The Content Production Pipeline

```
Niche Selection → Script Generation → Visual Creation → Audio Layer → Assembly → Export
```

## Step 1: Niche Selection Framework

### Criteria for Winning Niches

| Competition Gap | 20% | Is there room for new players? |
| Evergreen Potential | 15% | Will this work in 6 months? |

```

**Go/No-Go Threshold:** 35+ points

## Step 2: Script Generation System

### Hook Formulas That Work

**Pattern Interrupt Hooks:**
- "Stop scrolling if you want to..."
- "Nobody is talking about this..."
- "I can't believe this actually works..."

**Curiosity Gap Hooks:**
- "The #1 reason you're not [achieving X]..."
- "What [successful people] know that you don't..."
- "Here's what happens when you [action]..."

**Authority Hooks:**
- "After [X years] in [industry], here's what I learned..."
- "[Number] lessons from building [achievement]..."
- "The [industry] secret they don't want you to know..."

**Controversial Hooks:**
- "Unpopular opinion: [statement]"
- "Why [common belief] is completely wrong"
- "[Thing everyone does] is keeping you broke"

### Script Structure (60-Second Formula)

```
[0-3s] HOOK - Pattern interrupt, curiosity, or controversy
[3-15s] PROBLEM - Agitate the pain point
[15-35s] SOLUTION - Present your framework/method
[35-50s] PROOF - Social proof, results, credibility
[50-60s] CTA - Clear call to action (link in bio)
```

### AI Script Generation Prompts

  /bodies
    - listicles/
    - stories/

  /ctas
    - soft_ctas.txt

| Phase | Videos/Day | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Testing | 10-20 | Finding winning formats |

- Organize into content calendar (5 min)
```

**Hour 1: Production (30 min)**

## Saving Winners

When a video hits 100k+ views:

1. **Document the script** - Save exact wording
2. **Screenshot analytics** - Views, likes, shares, watch time
3. **Note the variables:**
   - Time posted
   - Day of week
   - Hook used
   - Visual style
   - Sound/music
   - Hashtags
4. **Create variations** - 5-10 remixes of winning formula
5. **Add to "proven" folder** - For scaling phase

### Winner Variation Strategy

Original: "5 apps that pay you $100/day"
Variations:
- "5 DIFFERENT apps that pay you $100/day"
- "5 apps that pay you while you sleep"
- "I made $3k last month from these 5 apps"
