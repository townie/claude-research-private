# Local SEO Strategy: The Hidden Pages Approach

## The Problem

Many businesses copy their competitor's homepage word-for-word and still can't rank in local search. Why? Because the homepage is just the tip of the iceberg.

## What Top Competitors Are Actually Doing

Successful local businesses often have **50+ location-specific pages** buried in their sitemap that drive the majority of their local search traffic.

### Types of Hidden Pages

1. **Service + Location Pages**
   - "Plumber in [City Name]"
   - "Emergency Plumbing [Suburb]"
   - "24 Hour HVAC Repair [Neighborhood]"

2. **Service Area Breakdowns**
   - Dedicated pages for each city/town served
   - Neighborhood-specific landing pages
   - County or region overview pages

3. **Local Case Studies**

   - Before/after content with local context
   - Customer success stories by area

4. **Local Resource Pages**

   - "Common [Problem] Issues in [Region]"
   - Seasonal guides specific to local climate/conditions
